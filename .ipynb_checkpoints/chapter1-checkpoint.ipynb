    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad field of creating machines that mimic human intelligence, including rule-based and learning-based systems. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that learn from data to improve over time without explicit programming. In short, **all ML is AI, but not all AI is ML**."
